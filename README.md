Web Development Immersive Project 2 CRUD CRAP application


Project Two requirements: create a full stack application using two models and mvc folder structure. Complete with Node.js, Express, Mongoose and EJS with RESTFUL routes.

During Unit 6 of the General Assembly course students learned about mongoDB and ejs dynamic web pages. This assignment was given after several days of building data bases using two models. In class students practiced by making models of authors which were related to models of articles. They also completed homework based on a previous students' project two assignment that had photographers that had photographs. We were prompted to think of things that relate to each other to come up with what our apps could be about.

During the week leading up the this assignment in mid April, my family has been gardening a lot. I decided that I would create an app where gardens could be made and plants could be put into them. I approached the assignment like the homework involving photographers and photos. Once I had a relationship working between the gardens and the plants I verified that my application was a full crud app for both models. I ran into some errors that resulted in me dropping the database a few times but once I had it running I set to altering the application to allow for asset images I drew and several other selection processes.

For the images I drew I took inspiration from the below pictures:
